# Participating on a existing projects

Follow the project, you will get emails when 
issues are added/changed as well as code.

It would be a good idea to follow the other projects 
so we can all collaborate.

# Why put your project on GitHub
The primary reason is to make it visible for potential:

*  [other developers](http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues)
*  [our members](http://codeforkc.org)
*  your team
*  stakeholders
*  users
*  google searches
*  media

Communications is another reason:

All sorts of people will visit your GitHub repo besides 
your team members.

What will they see when they visit your GitHub repo:

* Title
* Short Description
* URL to something
* Filelist
* Readme

Three other things

* Issues An example of a [non team member question](https://github.com/codeforkansascity/Neighborhood-Dashboard/issues/5#issuecomment-111887393).
* Wiki discussions in issues or slack
  can be summarized in the Wiki, and the Wiki can 
  be your projects documentation.
* gh-pages, you can create a simple web site for your app, 
  or host the app itself.


# How do I add a file to a repo

### Create a clone of the repository on your computer

1. Open up your GitHub client
1. File -> Clone Repository
2. Select the repository from the list, say your-repo
3. Clone it to a place of your liking (Project Directory)

### Add an image to the Project Directory

1. Locate the image you would like to upload
2. Drag/Drop it to the Project Directory you just created by cloning.
   This is also the time to create a directory for it, if you want.

### Add/Commit the image to the local Git repository

1. If not already open, Open up your GitHub client.
2. Select your clone
3. You should see the file you want uploaded
4. Add a summary and if you want description
5. Click "Commit to your-repo"

### Syncing up to GitHub

This process does two things,
pulls changes down to your clone of the project,
and pushes up changes on your clone to GitHub.


1. If not already open, Open up your GitHub client.
2.Select your-repo
3. Click "Sync" in the upper right hand corner.
