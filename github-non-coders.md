# Why put your project on GitHub
The primary reason is to make it visible for potential:

*  developers
*  stakeholders
*  users
*  media

Communications is another reason:

You want to communicate to your team as well as
non team members will want to communicate to you.

* If you follow the project you will be alerted
  when issues are added and change.  
  When code is changed.
* Discussions in issues or slack
  can be summarized in the Wiki
* You can create a simple web site for your app, 
  or host the app itself.

# Participating on a existing projects


# Working on an existing project with GitHub client

### Create a clone on your computer

1. Open up your GitHub client
1. File -> Clone Repository
2. Select the repository from the list, say your-repo
3. Clone it to a place of your liking (Project Directory)

### Add an image to the Project Directory

1. Locate the image you would like to upload
2. Drag/Drop it to the Project Directory you just created by cloning.
   This is also the time to create a directory for it, if you want.

### Add/Commit the image to the local Git repository

1. If not already open, Open up your GitHub client.
2. Select your clone
3. You should see the file you want uploaded
4. Add a summary and if you want description
5. Click "Commit to your-repo"

### Syncing up to GitHub

This process does two things,
pulls changes down to your clone of the project,
and pushes up changes on your clone to GitHub.


1. If not already open, Open up your GitHub client.
2  Select your-repo
3. Click "Sync" in the upper right hand corner.
